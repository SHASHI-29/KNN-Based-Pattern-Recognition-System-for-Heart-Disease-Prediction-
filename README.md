# KNN-Based-Pattern-Recognition-System-for-Heart-Disease-Prediction-
This project implements a K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) based Heart Disease Prediction System using the popular UCI/Kaggle Heart Disease dataset. The model is trained using Python, Scikit-learn, and StandardScaler for feature normalization.
